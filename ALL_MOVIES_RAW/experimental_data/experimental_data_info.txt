For E1 and E2:
Original data used in the paper can be found here â€” see sample dataset: 
https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/SarcTrack

For E3, E4, and E5:
The full file sizes are too big for GitHub. Therefore, each movie is split into 5 parts. Once downloaded, the tifs can be merged into one file using:

import numpy as np
from skimage import io
from tifffile import imsave

fname_save = 'real_data_E3'
mat = np.zeros((150, 512, 512))
for kk in range(0,5):
	ix1 = kk*30
	ix2 = (kk+1)*30
	mat[ix1:ix2,:,:] = io.imread('ALL_MOVIES_RAW/real_data/real_data_E3_frame%i_to%i.tif'%(ix1,ix2-1))

imsave(fname_save,mat)
