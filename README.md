# Sarc-Graph
Segmentation, tracking, and analysis of sarcomeres in hiPSC-CMs

# Data

## Synthetic data

The synthetic data (synthetic_data_1, synthetic_data_2, and synthetic_data_3) are generated with the included scripts:

`geom_fcns.py`- 

`render_fcns.py` -

`synthetic_data_1.py`- 

`synthetic_data_2.py`- 

`synthetic_data_3.py`- 

## Real data

The real data (real_data_Sample_1 and real_data_Sample_2) was originally published with the paper ``An Adaptable Software Tool for Efficient Large-Scale Analysis of Sarcomere Function in hiPSC-Cardiomyocytes'' found at https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.314505 .
